# pipeline

- define interfaces between permissions(ACL), infrastructure workflow, development cycles,
  deployment cycles (to qa or test) and release cycles
- each cycle should be replaceable by others can can be switched in terms of
  tools or processes
    - break down each cycle into separate pieces and draw out the boundaries
    - permissions
- "team boundaries reflect in the product architecture" - Conways law
